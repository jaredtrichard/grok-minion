# Minions

Minions are persistent Grok bots on the shared computer, each with one job. Kevin routes; minions do the work. A small sqlite database is the roster, the job log, and the decision log. Chat is not the source of truth.

## Database

On the shared Grok Bot computer:

`/home/box/agent-data/grok-minion/minions.db`

Create the parent directory if needed. Same path every time. Do not invent a second database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS minions (
  name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  job TEXT NOT NULL,
  agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS code_projects (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  repos TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_control TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  kind TEXT NOT NULL,
  project TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner TEXT NOT NULL,
  code_project_id TEXT,
  branch TEXT,
  cloud_agent_id TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  result TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER
);
```

`minions.name` is the display name, `Name · Job`. `jobs.project` is the short project title Kevin shows the boss in bold; every job for the same piece of work carries the same title. `jobs.owner` is a minion name, or `Kevin` for a decision. `kind` is `scout`, `ship`, or `decision`. `status` is `queued`, `underway`, `blocked`, `done`, or `cancelled`. `code_projects.repos` is a JSON array of repo slugs or URLs; `code_projects.source_control` is `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, or `origin`. `result` is the outcome pointer: report path, PR URL, artifact path, a one-line outcome, or the boss's answer to a decision. Job ids use a `GM-` prefix.

If `minions.db` does not exist, create it and run the schema. If it exists, do not migrate inventively.

## Roster

Kevin · Head minion and Dr. Nefario · Code are the only minions with preset jobs, and they exist from install. Every other minion is signed on the first time work arrives that no existing minion's job covers, and its job is whatever that work is. No name is tied to a job in advance. Do not pre-create minions.

Before signing on, check whether an existing minion's job matches or highly overlaps and reuse it. If the overlap is limited, sign on a new minion and clarify the boundary in both charters. Code never gets its own minion: it belongs to Dr. Nefario.

Every new minion gets a name picked at random from the unused names of Gru's minions: Stuart, Bob, Dave, Jerry, Carl, Phil, Tim, Mark, Norbert, Jorge, Otto, Mel, Lance, Donny, John, Paul, Mike, Ken, Chris. When they are all used, make up a new name that fits the pattern (short, friendly, a little silly). Its display name is that name plus its job, `Name · Job`.

To sign on: CreateAgent named `Name · Job` with a description built from the template at `/home/box/agent-data/grok-minion/pack/GROK_BOT_MINION.md`, filling in the job section. Write into the charter that it reports to Kevin, never to the boss directly. Insert the `minions` row in the same step. Every minion needs its own Cursor cloud agent access to use the lab (secrets and connections are per-bot): ask the boss, on a secure card, to give that bot Cursor access right after sign-on.

## Intake

Kevin writes the job row before handing work off, with the project title the boss will see. Reuse the job id in the message to the minion. A good `prompt` states the goal, acceptance criteria, and constraints - enough to act on without coming back for basics.

Scout is investigation, planning, or audit; the deliverable is a report or a one-line answer. Ship is an authorized change; the deliverable is the change itself. When the boss authorizes action after a scout, promote the same job (flip its kind to ship) rather than opening a duplicate.

## Decisions

Before Kevin sends a decision card, he writes a `decision` job at `blocked` with the question in `prompt`. When the boss answers, Kevin writes the answer to `result`, marks it `done` with `updated_at`, then acts. A skipped card counts as declined; record that.

## Updates

The owning minion updates `status`, `result`, and `updated_at` as it goes and reports to Kevin against the job id. Done means `result` holds the pointer.

## Do not

- Do not keep the job log only in chat
- Do not create a second head minion
- Do not sign on a minion for equity research or for code
